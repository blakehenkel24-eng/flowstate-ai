# Flowstate AI — SMB Pivot Strategy

## The Shift
**From:** Chicago mid-market professional services (20-100 employees)  
**To:** Local SMBs (1-10 employees) — realtors, contractors, solo consultants, small agencies

**Why this works:**
- Lower competition (no Deloitte AI chasing these clients)
- Faster sales cycles (decision maker = owner, no procurement)
- Smaller scope = manageable with full-time job
- You can genuinely blow their minds (they've heard of AI but have zero implementation)

---

## Three Tiers (Revised for Reality)

### Tier 1: AI Kickstart — $500-750 one-time
**What:** Get them from "AI-curious" to "AI-using"

**Deliverables:**
- 1-hour workshop: "AI for [their industry]"
- ChatGPT Team setup (4-5 seats)
- Prompt library (10-15 industry-specific prompts)
- Basic automation audit (identify 2-3 quick wins)

**Time:** 3-4 hours total  
**Upsell path:** "Want me to build one of those automations I found?"

---

### Tier 2: Workflow Automation — $1,500 setup + $150/month
**What:** One working automation that saves them 5-10 hours/week

**Industry-Agnostic Options:**
1. **Lead Response Bot** — Auto-respond to form fills/emails within 5 minutes
2. **Meeting Prepper** — Auto-research leads before calls, send brief to inbox
3. **Content Generator** — Weekly blog/social posts from voice notes
4. **Follow-up Sequences** — Automated nurture emails based on behavior
5. **Document Processor** — Extract data from PDFs/emails to spreadsheet/CRM

**Deliverables:**
- Built workflow (Make/Zapier/OpenClaw)
- 30-day monitoring & tweaks
- Monthly maintenance (fix breaks, small improvements)

**Time to build:** 4-6 hours first one, 2-3 hours subsequent (templates)  
**Monthly:** ~30 min per client (mostly monitoring alerts)

---

### Tier 3: "AI Agent" Setup — $3,000 setup + $300/month
**What:** OpenClaw deployment branded as their 24/7 AI system

**What's Actually Included:**
- OpenClaw deployed on their VPS (or yours, resold)
- Custom cron jobs for their business:
  - Daily lead scraping
  - Weekly report generation
  - Competitor monitoring
  - Content scheduling
- 2-3 custom skills/workflows
- Branded dashboard (if using Cockpit A1 fork)
- Weekly "agent activity" report

**Caveat:** This is only viable if you can standardize. Don't do fully custom dev.

**Standardized "Agent Packages":**
- **Realtor Agent:** Daily new listing alerts, buyer nurture sequences, market report generator
- **Contractor Agent:** Lead qualification, estimate follow-up, review request automation
- **Consultant Agent:** Content pipeline, lead scoring, meeting prep

**Time to deploy:** 6-8 hours first one, 3-4 hours subsequent (cloning config)  
**Monthly:** ~1 hour per client (monitoring, small tweaks)

---

## Capacity Reality Check

**With your current schedule:**
- 2-3 hours/week available (train commute + some evenings)
- Can handle:
  - 1-2 Kickstarts per month (easy)
  - 1 Workflow client per month (sustainable)
  - OR 1 Agent client every 2 months (more lucrative but heavier)

**Recommended mix:**
- Start with Kickstarts (cash flow, low commitment)
- Upsell 30% to Workflows
- Agent tier only for right-fit clients (tech-comfortable, ongoing need)

---

## Positioning: "The AI Guy for [Your City]"

**Tagline ideas:**
- "AI made simple for Chicago small business"
- "Your competitors are using AI. Let's get you caught up."
- "1-hour AI setup. Zero tech skills required."

**Key messaging:**
- "You've heard about AI. I'll show you exactly what to do with it."
- No enterprise BS. No 6-month implementations. Working automation in 1 week.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Pick 3 target industries** — Which SMBs do you already know? Who's in your network?
2. **Build 1 demo workflow** — Pick the simplest (lead response bot). Document it.
3. **Create simple landing page** — One page, three tiers, calendar booking

### Month 1
1. **Soft launch to network** — "I'm helping small businesses use AI. Want a free audit?"
2. **First 2-3 clients at discount** — Case studies > profit initially
3. **Document everything** — Turn builds into reusable templates

### Month 2-3
1. **Systematize** — Template library, onboarding checklist, support process
2. **Raise prices** — Once you have case studies
3. **Referral program** — "Give $100, get $100" for existing clients

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Scope creep on custom builds | Strict "choose from menu" policy. Custom = 2x price. |
| Monthly churn | Annual prepay discount (2 months free). Front-load value. |
| Breaking automations | Build monitoring/alerting. Document everything. |
| Time overcommitment | Max 5 active clients. Waitlist if full. |
| Support burden | Office hours only (e.g., Tue/Thu 6-7pm). Not 24/7. |

## Open Questions

1. **Geographic focus:** Chicago area only? Or remote OK?
2. **Industry priority:** Realtors, contractors, or consultants first?
3. **Tech stack:** Make/Zapier (easier) or OpenClaw (differentiated)?
4. **Pricing:** Start low to learn, or price for value from day 1?
