"Which automation should I build first?"

It's the question I get most often. And my answer always starts with a question back:

**"What's your biggest time suck that directly impacts revenue?"**

Because here's the thing: Not all automations are created equal. Some save time. Some make money. The best ones do both.

## The Automation Priority Matrix

I evaluate every potential automation on two axes:

**Time Saved (Low → High)**  
**Revenue Impact (Low → High)**

Here's where common automations fall:

### High Time, Low Revenue (Avoid These First)
- Fancy email signatures
- Auto-formatting spreadsheets
- Social media post scheduling (without strategy)

*Why avoid:* They look cool but don't move the needle.

### Low Time, High Revenue (Quick Wins)
- Instant lead response
- Quote/estimate generators
- Review requesters

*Why prioritize:* Easy to build, immediate ROI.

### High Time, High Revenue (The Sweet Spot)
- Document processing pipelines
- Follow-up sequences
- Meeting prepper systems

*Why these win:* Compounding returns over time.

### Low Time, Low Revenue (Skip Entirely)
- Most "AI-powered" gimmicks
- Automation for automation's sake

## The 3-Question Filter

Before I build anything for a client, I ask:

### 1. "How many hours per week does this take you now?"

If it's less than 2 hours/week, it's probably not worth automating yet. Focus on bigger time sinks first.

### 2. "What's the cost of NOT doing this?"

Some tasks don't take much time but have huge opportunity costs:
- Slow lead response = lost deals
- No follow-up = wasted networking
- Manual quotes = slower close rates

### 3. "Will this still matter in 6 months?"

Don't automate processes you're still figuring out. Wait until:
- The workflow is stable
- You know what "good" looks like
- You're doing it consistently

## Real Client Example: The Contractor

A home services contractor came to me wanting to "automate everything." 

Instead, I asked him to track his time for one week. Here's what we found:

| Task | Hours/Week | Revenue Impact |
|------|------------|----------------|
| Invoicing | 4 hrs | Medium (cash flow) |
| Lead response | 2 hrs | **HIGH** (lost deals) |
| Quote generation | 6 hrs | **HIGH** (sales speed) |
| Follow-ups | 3 hrs | **HIGH** (close rate) |
| Scheduling | 2 hrs | Medium |
| Social media | 2 hrs | Low |

**What we automated first:**
1. Lead response (2 hrs saved, high revenue impact)
2. Quote generator (6 hrs saved, high revenue impact)
3. Follow-up sequences (3 hrs saved, high revenue impact)

**Total:** 11 hours/week saved, significant revenue increase

**What we skipped (for now):** Social media scheduling — low impact, and he wasn't consistent with it anyway.

## The ROI Calculation

Before building any automation, do this math:

```
Monthly Time Saved × Your Hourly Value = Monthly Value

Monthly Value - Automation Cost = Net Monthly Benefit

Net Monthly Benefit × 12 = Annual ROI
```

**Example:**
- Automation saves 5 hours/week = 20 hours/month
- Your time is worth $100/hour (what you could bill or what revenue you generate)
- Monthly value = $2,000
- Automation cost = $200/month
- Net monthly benefit = $1,800
- **Annual ROI = $21,600**

If the annual ROI isn't at least 3x the setup cost, reconsider.

## Red Flags: Automations That Usually Fail

I've seen these patterns lead to abandoned projects:

**❌ Automating a broken process**  
Fix the process first, then automate it.

**❌ Trying to automate everything at once**  
Pick ONE high-impact automation. Get it working. Then add another.

**❌ No one owns the automation**  
Someone needs to monitor it, tweak it, and fix it when it breaks.

**❌ Expecting 100% automation**  
Most automations need human oversight. Plan for 80% automated, 20% reviewed.

**❌ Ignoring the maintenance cost**  
Budget $150-300/month for monitoring, updates, and fixes.

## The 30-Day Test

Here's my recommendation for every business:

**Week 1:** Track your time. Where are your 10+ hour/week tasks?

**Week 2:** Pick ONE that has both time savings AND revenue impact.

**Week 3:** Build or buy that automation.

**Week 4:** Measure results. Did it work? Should you tweak it or move on?

**Month 2+:** Repeat with the next highest-impact automation.

## Need Help Prioritizing?

Most business owners are too close to their own operations to see the biggest opportunities.

That's why I offer free 20-minute audits. I'll ask you about:
- Where you spend your time
- Where leads get lost
- Where deals stall
- What keeps you up at night

Then I'll tell you exactly which automation to build first and why.
