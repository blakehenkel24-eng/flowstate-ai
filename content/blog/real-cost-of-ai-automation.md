"How much does AI automation cost?"

I get this question constantly. And most people are surprised by my answer:

**Less than you're already spending on the manual work.**

Let me show you the real numbers.

## The Hidden Cost of "Doing It Yourself"

Most small business owners don't track their time. So they don't realize how expensive manual work actually is.

Here's a typical week for a small business owner I worked with:

| Task | Hours/Week | Annual Hours |
|------|------------|--------------|
| Email management | 8 | 416 |
| Lead follow-up | 4 | 208 |
| Quote generation | 5 | 260 |
| Data entry | 3 | 156 |
| Scheduling | 2 | 104 |
| **Total** | **22** | **1,144** |

That's **22 hours per week** on administrative tasks. At a conservative $75/hour value (what they could bill or revenue-generating time), that's:

**$85,800 per year** spent on tasks that don't grow the business.

And that's not counting:
- Errors from manual data entry
- Lost leads from slow response
- Missed opportunities from being overwhelmed

## What Automation Actually Costs

Let's price out a realistic automation setup:

### One-Time Setup Costs

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Workflow automation (lead response + follow-up) | $2,000 |
| Document processor (invoices/quotes) | $1,500 |
| AI setup and training | $500 |
| **Total Setup** | **$4,000** |

### Monthly Costs

| Component | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|--------------|
| Zapier/Make (automation platform) | $50 |
| OpenAI API (AI features) | $30 |
| Monitoring and maintenance | $200 |
| **Total Monthly** | **$280** |

**Year 1 Total:** $4,000 + ($280 × 12) = **$7,360**

**Year 2+ Total:** $280 × 12 = **$3,360**

## The ROI Math

Let's compare:

| Approach | Year 1 Cost | Year 2+ Cost | Time Reclaimed |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Do it manually | $85,800 (your time) | $85,800 | 0 hours |
| Hire assistant | $40,000+ | $40,000+ | 20 hours (but now you manage someone) |
| **AI Automation** | **$7,360** | **$3,360** | **15-20 hours/week** |

**Year 1 savings:** $78,440  
**Year 2+ savings:** $82,440 per year

Even if you only value your time at $50/hour (very conservative), automation pays for itself in 2-3 months.

## The "But I Can't Afford It" Objection

I hear this a lot. Here's how I respond:

**"I don't have $4,000 to spend on automation."**

Okay, but you're already spending $85,000/year in time. You just don't see it as a line item.

**"What if it doesn't work?"**

Fair concern. That's why I offer:
- 30-day tweaking period included
- Start with ONE automation (~$1,500) to prove ROI
- Month-to-month maintenance (no long-term contracts)

**"What if something breaks?"**

Maintenance is included. Most issues are fixed within hours. Compare that to an employee getting sick or quitting.

## The Scaling Factor

Here's what most people miss: **Automation scales better than people.**

When your business grows:
- A manual process takes MORE time
- An employee needs help or gets overwhelmed
- **Automation just keeps working**

I had a realtor client who went from 20 leads/month to 80 leads/month. Their old system would have required hiring an assistant. The automation handled it without breaking a sweat.

## The Real Comparison

Let's be honest about your options:

### Option 1: Keep Doing It Manually
- Cost: $85,000+/year in time
- Quality: Inconsistent (depends on your energy/stress)
- Scalability: Terrible
- Flexibility: None

### Option 2: Hire Someone
- Cost: $40,000+/year + benefits + taxes + management time
- Quality: Variable (training, turnover)
- Scalability: Limited
- Flexibility: Low (hard to change processes)

### Option 3: AI Automation
- Cost: $3,000-7,000/year
- Quality: Consistent 24/7
- Scalability: Excellent
- Flexibility: High (easy to modify)

## When Automation Doesn't Make Sense

I'm not going to sell you something you don't need. Automation is NOT right for:

- **Processes you do less than 2 hours/week** — not worth the overhead
- **Tasks requiring complex human judgment** — AI isn't there yet
- **One-off or irregular tasks** — can't automate what you don't repeat
- **Businesses with <$100k revenue** — focus on sales first

## How to Start Small

You don't need to automate everything at once. Here's a low-risk approach:

**Month 1:** Build ONE high-impact automation (~$1,500)
- Pick your biggest time waster
- Prove ROI
- Get comfortable with the system

**Month 2-3:** If it's working, add automation #2

**Month 4+:** Keep adding as budget allows

Most of my clients start with the [Workflow Automation package](/#services) at $1,500-3,000, then add more over time.

## The Bottom Line

Stop thinking about automation as an expense. It's an investment that pays for itself in 2-3 months and keeps returning value for years.

The real question isn't "Can I afford automation?"

It's: **"Can I afford to keep doing this manually?"**
