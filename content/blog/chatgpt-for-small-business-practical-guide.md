Everyone's telling you to use ChatGPT. But when you open it up, you stare at the blank box thinking... *"Okay, now what?"*

After training dozens of small business teams on ChatGPT, I've seen what actually works versus what's just hype. Here's the no-BS guide.

## What ChatGPT Is Actually Good At

ChatGPT excels at three things for small businesses:

1. **First drafts** — Emails, social posts, proposals (you still need to edit)
2. **Research assistant** — Summarizing articles, comparing options, explaining concepts
3. **Brainstorming partner** — Generating ideas when you're stuck

What it's NOT good at:
- Replacing your judgment (always fact-check)
- Handling sensitive customer communications (without review)
- Legal or financial advice (seriously, don't)

## The Prompt Framework That Actually Works

Most people write prompts like: *"Write me an email to a client"*

That's why they get generic garbage back.

Here's the framework I teach every client:

```
ROLE: [Who should ChatGPT act as?]
CONTEXT: [What's the situation?]
TASK: [What specifically do you want?]
FORMAT: [How should it look?]
TONE: [What style?]
CONSTRAINTS: [What to avoid?]
```

**Example:**

> ROLE: Experienced real estate agent  
> CONTEXT: Following up with a potential buyer who toured a house last week but hasn't made an offer  
> TASK: Write a follow-up email that provides value (market update) without being pushy  
> FORMAT: Short email, 3-4 sentences max  
> TONE: Professional but warm, not salesy  
> CONSTRAINTS: Don't mention the specific house, don't ask if they're still interested

See the difference? Specificity gets results.

## 5 ChatGPT Uses That Save Real Time

### 1. Email Templates (That Don't Sound Like Templates)

**Instead of:** Writing the same "Thanks for reaching out" email 50 times  
**Do this:** Create 5 variations for different scenarios, save them, customize as needed

**Prompt:**
> Write 3 variations of a professional email responding to a new inquiry. The business is [YOUR BUSINESS]. Tone should be warm but efficient. Include: acknowledgment of their message, next steps, and timeline.

### 2. Social Media Content Batch

**Instead of:** Staring at a blank screen daily  
**Do this:** Generate a month's worth of content ideas in one session

**Prompt:**
> I'm a [CONTRACTOR/REALTOR/CONSULTANT]. Give me 20 social media post ideas that: 1) Show expertise without being boring, 2) Include a mix of educational, behind-the-scenes, and client-focused content, 3) Would appeal to [TARGET AUDIENCE]. Format as a table with: Post Type, Hook/First Line, Content Idea.

### 3. Proposal/Quote Drafts

**Instead of:** Starting from scratch every time  
**Do this:** Generate first drafts from bullet points

**Prompt:**
> Turn these bullet points into a professional proposal: [PASTE BULLETS]. Format with: Introduction, Scope of Work, Timeline, Investment, Next Steps. Tone: Professional but conversational.

### 4. Meeting Summaries

**Instead of:** Scrambling to remember action items  > **Do this:** Paste your messy notes, get a clean summary

**Prompt:**
> Organize these messy meeting notes into: 1) Key Decisions Made, 2) Action Items (with owners), 3) Open Questions. Notes: [PASTE NOTES]

### 5. Competitive Research

**Instead of:** Spending hours on Google  
**Do this:** Get a structured comparison in seconds

**Prompt:**
> Compare [COMPETITOR A] vs [COMPETITOR B] for [USE CASE]. Include: pricing, key features, pros/cons, best for [SITUATION]. Format as a comparison table.

## Building Your Prompt Library

Here's what I do with every client:

1. **Start a document** (Google Doc, Notion, whatever)
2. **Every time you write a good prompt, save it**
3. **Organize by use case** (emails, social, proposals, etc.)
4. **Refine over time** — you'll see what works

After a month, you'll have 20-30 prompts that work for YOUR business. That's when ChatGPT becomes actually useful.

## The $500 Mistake I See Every Week

Businesses buy ChatGPT Team licenses for their whole team... but nobody knows how to use them.

**Don't do this:**
- Buy licenses without training
- Expect people to "figure it out"
- Let everyone use different prompts (inconsistent output)

**Do this instead:**
1. Start with 1-2 power users
2. Build your prompt library
3. Train the team with specific use cases
4. Roll out gradually

This is exactly what my [AI Kickstart](/#services) package covers. One session, your whole team trained, custom prompt library built for your business.

## Bottom Line

ChatGPT is a tool, not a magic wand. The businesses getting the most value:

- Have specific use cases (not "we should use AI")
- Build and refine prompt libraries
- Train their team properly
- Review and edit output (don't blindly trust)
