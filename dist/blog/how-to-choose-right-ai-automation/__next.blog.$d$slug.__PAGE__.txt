3:T16c1,<p>"Which automation should I build first?"</p>
<p>It's the question I get most often. And my answer always starts with a question back:</p>
<p><strong>"What's your biggest time suck that directly impacts revenue?"</strong></p>
<p>Because here's the thing: Not all automations are created equal. Some save time. Some make money. The best ones do both.</p>
<h2>The Automation Priority Matrix</h2>
<p>I evaluate every potential automation on two axes:</p>
<p><strong>Time Saved (Low → High)</strong><br>
<strong>Revenue Impact (Low → High)</strong></p>
<p>Here's where common automations fall:</p>
<h3>High Time, Low Revenue (Avoid These First)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fancy email signatures</li>
<li>Auto-formatting spreadsheets</li>
<li>Social media post scheduling (without strategy)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why avoid:</em> They look cool but don't move the needle.</p>
<h3>Low Time, High Revenue (Quick Wins)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Instant lead response</li>
<li>Quote/estimate generators</li>
<li>Review requesters</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why prioritize:</em> Easy to build, immediate ROI.</p>
<h3>High Time, High Revenue (The Sweet Spot)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Document processing pipelines</li>
<li>Follow-up sequences</li>
<li>Meeting prepper systems</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why these win:</em> Compounding returns over time.</p>
<h3>Low Time, Low Revenue (Skip Entirely)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most "AI-powered" gimmicks</li>
<li>Automation for automation's sake</li>
</ul>
<h2>The 3-Question Filter</h2>
<p>Before I build anything for a client, I ask:</p>
<h3>1. "How many hours per week does this take you now?"</h3>
<p>If it's less than 2 hours/week, it's probably not worth automating yet. Focus on bigger time sinks first.</p>
<h3>2. "What's the cost of NOT doing this?"</h3>
<p>Some tasks don't take much time but have huge opportunity costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slow lead response = lost deals</li>
<li>No follow-up = wasted networking</li>
<li>Manual quotes = slower close rates</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. "Will this still matter in 6 months?"</h3>
<p>Don't automate processes you're still figuring out. Wait until:</p>
<ul>
<li>The workflow is stable</li>
<li>You know what "good" looks like</li>
<li>You're doing it consistently</li>
</ul>
<h2>Real Client Example: The Contractor</h2>
<p>A home services contractor came to me wanting to "automate everything."</p>
<p>Instead, I asked him to track his time for one week. Here's what we found:</p>
<p>| Task | Hours/Week | Revenue Impact |
|------|------------|----------------|
| Invoicing | 4 hrs | Medium (cash flow) |
| Lead response | 2 hrs | <strong>HIGH</strong> (lost deals) |
| Quote generation | 6 hrs | <strong>HIGH</strong> (sales speed) |
| Follow-ups | 3 hrs | <strong>HIGH</strong> (close rate) |
| Scheduling | 2 hrs | Medium |
| Social media | 2 hrs | Low |</p>
<p><strong>What we automated first:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Lead response (2 hrs saved, high revenue impact)</li>
<li>Quote generator (6 hrs saved, high revenue impact)</li>
<li>Follow-up sequences (3 hrs saved, high revenue impact)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Total:</strong> 11 hours/week saved, significant revenue increase</p>
<p><strong>What we skipped (for now):</strong> Social media scheduling — low impact, and he wasn't consistent with it anyway.</p>
<h2>The ROI Calculation</h2>
<p>Before building any automation, do this math:</p>
<pre><code>Monthly Time Saved × Your Hourly Value = Monthly Value

Monthly Value - Automation Cost = Net Monthly Benefit

Net Monthly Benefit × 12 = Annual ROI
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Automation saves 5 hours/week = 20 hours/month</li>
<li>Your time is worth $100/hour (what you could bill or what revenue you generate)</li>
<li>Monthly value = $2,000</li>
<li>Automation cost = $200/month</li>
<li>Net monthly benefit = $1,800</li>
<li><strong>Annual ROI = $21,600</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If the annual ROI isn't at least 3x the setup cost, reconsider.</p>
<h2>Red Flags: Automations That Usually Fail</h2>
<p>I've seen these patterns lead to abandoned projects:</p>
<p><strong>❌ Automating a broken process</strong><br>
Fix the process first, then automate it.</p>
<p><strong>❌ Trying to automate everything at once</strong><br>
Pick ONE high-impact automation. Get it working. Then add another.</p>
<p><strong>❌ No one owns the automation</strong><br>
Someone needs to monitor it, tweak it, and fix it when it breaks.</p>
<p><strong>❌ Expecting 100% automation</strong><br>
Most automations need human oversight. Plan for 80% automated, 20% reviewed.</p>
<p><strong>❌ Ignoring the maintenance cost</strong><br>
Budget $150-300/month for monitoring, updates, and fixes.</p>
<h2>The 30-Day Test</h2>
<p>Here's my recommendation for every business:</p>
<p><strong>Week 1:</strong> Track your time. Where are your 10+ hour/week tasks?</p>
<p><strong>Week 2:</strong> Pick ONE that has both time savings AND revenue impact.</p>
<p><strong>Week 3:</strong> Build or buy that automation.</p>
<p><strong>Week 4:</strong> Measure results. Did it work? Should you tweak it or move on?</p>
<p><strong>Month 2+:</strong> Repeat with the next highest-impact automation.</p>
<h2>Need Help Prioritizing?</h2>
<p>Most business owners are too close to their own operations to see the biggest opportunities.</p>
<p>That's why I offer free 20-minute audits. I'll ask you about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where you spend your time</li>
<li>Where leads get lost</li>
<li>Where deals stall</li>
<li>What keeps you up at night</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I'll tell you exactly which automation to build first and why.</p>
