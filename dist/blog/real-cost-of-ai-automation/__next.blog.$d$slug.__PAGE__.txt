3:T18cc,<p>"How much does AI automation cost?"</p>
<p>I get this question constantly. And most people are surprised by my answer:</p>
<p><strong>Less than you're already spending on the manual work.</strong></p>
<p>Let me show you the real numbers.</p>
<h2>The Hidden Cost of "Doing It Yourself"</h2>
<p>Most small business owners don't track their time. So they don't realize how expensive manual work actually is.</p>
<p>Here's a typical week for a small business owner I worked with:</p>
<p>| Task | Hours/Week | Annual Hours |
|------|------------|--------------|
| Email management | 8 | 416 |
| Lead follow-up | 4 | 208 |
| Quote generation | 5 | 260 |
| Data entry | 3 | 156 |
| Scheduling | 2 | 104 |
| <strong>Total</strong> | <strong>22</strong> | <strong>1,144</strong> |</p>
<p>That's <strong>22 hours per week</strong> on administrative tasks. At a conservative $75/hour value (what they could bill or revenue-generating time), that's:</p>
<p><strong>$85,800 per year</strong> spent on tasks that don't grow the business.</p>
<p>And that's not counting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Errors from manual data entry</li>
<li>Lost leads from slow response</li>
<li>Missed opportunities from being overwhelmed</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Automation Actually Costs</h2>
<p>Let's price out a realistic automation setup:</p>
<h3>One-Time Setup Costs</h3>
<p>| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Workflow automation (lead response + follow-up) | $2,000 |
| Document processor (invoices/quotes) | $1,500 |
| AI setup and training | $500 |
| <strong>Total Setup</strong> | <strong>$4,000</strong> |</p>
<h3>Monthly Costs</h3>
<p>| Component | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|--------------|
| Zapier/Make (automation platform) | $50 |
| OpenAI API (AI features) | $30 |
| Monitoring and maintenance | $200 |
| <strong>Total Monthly</strong> | <strong>$280</strong> |</p>
<p><strong>Year 1 Total:</strong> $4,000 + ($280 × 12) = <strong>$7,360</strong></p>
<p><strong>Year 2+ Total:</strong> $280 × 12 = <strong>$3,360</strong></p>
<h2>The ROI Math</h2>
<p>Let's compare:</p>
<p>| Approach | Year 1 Cost | Year 2+ Cost | Time Reclaimed |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Do it manually | $85,800 (your time) | $85,800 | 0 hours |
| Hire assistant | $40,000+ | $40,000+ | 20 hours (but now you manage someone) |
| <strong>AI Automation</strong> | <strong>$7,360</strong> | <strong>$3,360</strong> | <strong>15-20 hours/week</strong> |</p>
<p><strong>Year 1 savings:</strong> $78,440<br>
<strong>Year 2+ savings:</strong> $82,440 per year</p>
<p>Even if you only value your time at $50/hour (very conservative), automation pays for itself in 2-3 months.</p>
<h2>The "But I Can't Afford It" Objection</h2>
<p>I hear this a lot. Here's how I respond:</p>
<p><strong>"I don't have $4,000 to spend on automation."</strong></p>
<p>Okay, but you're already spending $85,000/year in time. You just don't see it as a line item.</p>
<p><strong>"What if it doesn't work?"</strong></p>
<p>Fair concern. That's why I offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>30-day tweaking period included</li>
<li>Start with ONE automation (~$1,500) to prove ROI</li>
<li>Month-to-month maintenance (no long-term contracts)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>"What if something breaks?"</strong></p>
<p>Maintenance is included. Most issues are fixed within hours. Compare that to an employee getting sick or quitting.</p>
<h2>The Scaling Factor</h2>
<p>Here's what most people miss: <strong>Automation scales better than people.</strong></p>
<p>When your business grows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A manual process takes MORE time</li>
<li>An employee needs help or gets overwhelmed</li>
<li><strong>Automation just keeps working</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I had a realtor client who went from 20 leads/month to 80 leads/month. Their old system would have required hiring an assistant. The automation handled it without breaking a sweat.</p>
<h2>The Real Comparison</h2>
<p>Let's be honest about your options:</p>
<h3>Option 1: Keep Doing It Manually</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cost: $85,000+/year in time</li>
<li>Quality: Inconsistent (depends on your energy/stress)</li>
<li>Scalability: Terrible</li>
<li>Flexibility: None</li>
</ul>
<h3>Option 2: Hire Someone</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cost: $40,000+/year + benefits + taxes + management time</li>
<li>Quality: Variable (training, turnover)</li>
<li>Scalability: Limited</li>
<li>Flexibility: Low (hard to change processes)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Option 3: AI Automation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cost: $3,000-7,000/year</li>
<li>Quality: Consistent 24/7</li>
<li>Scalability: Excellent</li>
<li>Flexibility: High (easy to modify)</li>
</ul>
<h2>When Automation Doesn't Make Sense</h2>
<p>I'm not going to sell you something you don't need. Automation is NOT right for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Processes you do less than 2 hours/week</strong> — not worth the overhead</li>
<li><strong>Tasks requiring complex human judgment</strong> — AI isn't there yet</li>
<li><strong>One-off or irregular tasks</strong> — can't automate what you don't repeat</li>
<li><strong>Businesses with &#x3C;$100k revenue</strong> — focus on sales first</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Start Small</h2>
<p>You don't need to automate everything at once. Here's a low-risk approach:</p>
<p><strong>Month 1:</strong> Build ONE high-impact automation (~$1,500)</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick your biggest time waster</li>
<li>Prove ROI</li>
<li>Get comfortable with the system</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Month 2-3:</strong> If it's working, add automation #2</p>
<p><strong>Month 4+:</strong> Keep adding as budget allows</p>
<p>Most of my clients start with the <a href="/#services">Workflow Automation package</a> at $1,500-3,000, then add more over time.</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Stop thinking about automation as an expense. It's an investment that pays for itself in 2-3 months and keeps returning value for years.</p>
<p>The real question isn't "Can I afford automation?"</p>
<p>It's: <strong>"Can I afford to keep doing this manually?"</strong></p>
