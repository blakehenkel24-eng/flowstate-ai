3:T1789,<p>Everyone's telling you to use ChatGPT. But when you open it up, you stare at the blank box thinking... <em>"Okay, now what?"</em></p>
<p>After training dozens of small business teams on ChatGPT, I've seen what actually works versus what's just hype. Here's the no-BS guide.</p>
<h2>What ChatGPT Is Actually Good At</h2>
<p>ChatGPT excels at three things for small businesses:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>First drafts</strong> — Emails, social posts, proposals (you still need to edit)</li>
<li><strong>Research assistant</strong> — Summarizing articles, comparing options, explaining concepts</li>
<li><strong>Brainstorming partner</strong> — Generating ideas when you're stuck</li>
</ol>
<p>What it's NOT good at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replacing your judgment (always fact-check)</li>
<li>Handling sensitive customer communications (without review)</li>
<li>Legal or financial advice (seriously, don't)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Prompt Framework That Actually Works</h2>
<p>Most people write prompts like: <em>"Write me an email to a client"</em></p>
<p>That's why they get generic garbage back.</p>
<p>Here's the framework I teach every client:</p>
<pre><code>ROLE: [Who should ChatGPT act as?]
CONTEXT: [What's the situation?]
TASK: [What specifically do you want?]
FORMAT: [How should it look?]
TONE: [What style?]
CONSTRAINTS: [What to avoid?]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ROLE: Experienced real estate agent<br>
CONTEXT: Following up with a potential buyer who toured a house last week but hasn't made an offer<br>
TASK: Write a follow-up email that provides value (market update) without being pushy<br>
FORMAT: Short email, 3-4 sentences max<br>
TONE: Professional but warm, not salesy<br>
CONSTRAINTS: Don't mention the specific house, don't ask if they're still interested</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the difference? Specificity gets results.</p>
<h2>5 ChatGPT Uses That Save Real Time</h2>
<h3>1. Email Templates (That Don't Sound Like Templates)</h3>
<p><strong>Instead of:</strong> Writing the same "Thanks for reaching out" email 50 times<br>
<strong>Do this:</strong> Create 5 variations for different scenarios, save them, customize as needed</p>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write 3 variations of a professional email responding to a new inquiry. The business is [YOUR BUSINESS]. Tone should be warm but efficient. Include: acknowledgment of their message, next steps, and timeline.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>2. Social Media Content Batch</h3>
<p><strong>Instead of:</strong> Staring at a blank screen daily<br>
<strong>Do this:</strong> Generate a month's worth of content ideas in one session</p>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm a [CONTRACTOR/REALTOR/CONSULTANT]. Give me 20 social media post ideas that: 1) Show expertise without being boring, 2) Include a mix of educational, behind-the-scenes, and client-focused content, 3) Would appeal to [TARGET AUDIENCE]. Format as a table with: Post Type, Hook/First Line, Content Idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>3. Proposal/Quote Drafts</h3>
<p><strong>Instead of:</strong> Starting from scratch every time<br>
<strong>Do this:</strong> Generate first drafts from bullet points</p>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn these bullet points into a professional proposal: [PASTE BULLETS]. Format with: Introduction, Scope of Work, Timeline, Investment, Next Steps. Tone: Professional but conversational.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>4. Meeting Summaries</h3>
<p><strong>Instead of:</strong> Scrambling to remember action items  > <strong>Do this:</strong> Paste your messy notes, get a clean summary</p>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Organize these messy meeting notes into: 1) Key Decisions Made, 2) Action Items (with owners), 3) Open Questions. Notes: [PASTE NOTES]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>5. Competitive Research</h3>
<p><strong>Instead of:</strong> Spending hours on Google<br>
<strong>Do this:</strong> Get a structured comparison in seconds</p>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compare [COMPETITOR A] vs [COMPETITOR B] for [USE CASE]. Include: pricing, key features, pros/cons, best for [SITUATION]. Format as a comparison table.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Building Your Prompt Library</h2>
<p>Here's what I do with every client:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start a document</strong> (Google Doc, Notion, whatever)</li>
<li><strong>Every time you write a good prompt, save it</strong></li>
<li><strong>Organize by use case</strong> (emails, social, proposals, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Refine over time</strong> — you'll see what works</li>
</ol>
<p>After a month, you'll have 20-30 prompts that work for YOUR business. That's when ChatGPT becomes actually useful.</p>
<h2>The $500 Mistake I See Every Week</h2>
<p>Businesses buy ChatGPT Team licenses for their whole team... but nobody knows how to use them.</p>
<p><strong>Don't do this:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Buy licenses without training</li>
<li>Expect people to "figure it out"</li>
<li>Let everyone use different prompts (inconsistent output)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do this instead:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Start with 1-2 power users</li>
<li>Build your prompt library</li>
<li>Train the team with specific use cases</li>
<li>Roll out gradually</li>
</ol>
<p>This is exactly what my <a href="/#services">AI Kickstart</a> package covers. One session, your whole team trained, custom prompt library built for your business.</p>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<p>ChatGPT is a tool, not a magic wand. The businesses getting the most value:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have specific use cases (not "we should use AI")</li>
<li>Build and refine prompt libraries</li>
<li>Train their team properly</li>
<li>Review and edit output (don't blindly trust)</li>
</ul>
